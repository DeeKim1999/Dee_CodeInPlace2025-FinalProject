# Dee_CodeInPlace2025-FinalProject (Dee's Flap & Track)

I will use this repository for academic purposes only.


> My CiP 2025 project is a personalized take on the classic Flappy Bird that features unique custom graphics and an integrated "data analytics" dashboard to track your progress and game metrics across every flight. It took me a lot of time to build and document my project but I had a lot of fun along the way!!

## About The Project

"Dee's Flap & Track" is more than just a Flappy Bird clone; it's a showcase of custom game development combined with practical data analytics. Built with Pygame, this project features unique visual assets that give the beloved (and frustrating!) game a fresh look. What truly sets it apart is the integrated data logging and a powerful Matplotlib-based dashboard that allows players to visualize their scores, game durations, and track their performance evolution over time.

This project demonstrates:
* Game development fundamentals (game loops, collision detection, sprite management).
* Integration of custom assets for a unique aesthetic.
* Robust data handling (CSV logging) for persistent game records.
* Data analysis and visualization using `pandas` and `matplotlib` for player insights.

## Features

* **Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay:** Navigate a bird through an endless series of pipes.
* **Unique Custom Graphics:** Enjoy a fresh visual experience with specially designed bird, pipe, background, and ground assets.
* **Real-time Score Tracking:** Keep track of your score during each game.
* **Persistent Game Statistics:** View your all-time total games played, highest score, and average score directly in the game.
* **Integrated Data Logging:** Every game session's score and duration are automatically saved to a CSV file.
* **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** Launch an external dashboard to visualize:
    * **Scores Over Time:** See your performance trend.
    * **Game Duration Distribution:** Understand how long your games typically last.
* **Responsive Game States:** Seamless transitions between menu, playing, game over, and statistics screens.
